# Programming with Python Workshop
This workshop introduces students to the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language through Turtle Graphics.

## Possible Durations
The material in this workshop is adaptable to several different timing options.

### 45 Minutes
For a 45 minute workshop, start with the follow-along and skip all of the optional sections. With any remaining time after the follow-along activity, students can work on the challenges.

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) (no optional sections) | 35m |
| [Turtle Challenges](https://bit.ly/PyChallenges) | 10m |

### 60 Minutes
For an hour long workshop, start with the follow-along. If the group is moving a little quicker, it may be beneficial to go over some of the optional sections. Either way, the students should have around 15 minutes to work on the challenges at the end.

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) (selected optional sections) | 45m |
| [Turtle Challenges](https://bit.ly/PyChallenges) | 15m |

### 1.5 Hours
For an hour-and-a-half workshop, start with an icebreaker. After that, move on to the follow-along. With this timeframe, it will be beneficial to go over all of the optional sections. Next, play the Kahoot that covers the material from the follow-along. After the follow-along, students can work on the challenges.

Sometimes, students will get bored with a long challenge portion. For this reason, it is recommended to limit the challenge time to 20 minutes.

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Icebreaker | 10m |
| [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) (with optional sections) | 50m |
| [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/duplicate-of-programming-with-python-quiz/94268b8a-33b6-49ad-b739-ef325c55c540) | 10m |
| [Turtle Challenges](https://bit.ly/PyChallenges) | 20m |

### 2.5 Hours
For a two-and-a-half-hour workshop, start with an icebreaker. After that, present the lecture PowerPoint, and play the Kahoot. It is recommended to take a break after the Kahoot, and then begin the follow-along activity. During the follow-along, complete all of the optional sections. After the follow-along, students can work on the challenges.

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Icebreaker | 10m |
| [Lecture](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) | 20m |
| [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/programming-with-python-quiz/e467016f-1971-4e14-b247-7e5e0f87c00c) | 10m |
| Break | 10m |
| [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) (with optional sections) | 50m |
| [Turtle Challenges](https://bit.ly/PyChallenges) | 50m |


## Icebreaker
The icebreaker activity is built into the [ProgrammingWithPython.pptx](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) presentation. Students will think of questions, and other students will have to answer them.

Optionally, instead of the PowerPoint icebreaker, choose a different icebreaker for the group. Or, depending on the situation, do not do an icebreaker activity.

## Lecture
The lecture introduces Python using the [Programming With Python](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) presentation. Students will follow along with the lecture using [trinket](https://trinket.io). The lecture covers:
- Python uses
- Trinket
- Printing messages
- Variables
- User input
- Conditionals
- For loops

It should be interactive, and the students should be engaged. The lecture is optional; if the duration is shorter, skip the lecture and start with the code-along.

## Kahoot
There is are two versions of the Kahoot for the workshop.

### Lecture Kahoot
If the PowerPoint was presented, use [this Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/programming-with-python-quiz/e467016f-1971-4e14-b247-7e5e0f87c00c) quiz that covers the content from the lecture. There is a link to the quiz from the [Programming With Python](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) presentation.

### Follow-Along Kahoot
If no PowerPoint was presented, use [this Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/duplicate-of-programming-with-python-quiz/94268b8a-33b6-49ad-b739-ef325c55c540) **AFTER** the follow-along activity. This version covers the content from the follow-along.

## Turtle Follow-Along
An instructor should walk through the instructions in the [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) file. Students should follow along and type what the instructor types. The instructor should ask questions of the students along the way, and make sure they are engaged and interacting.

### Follow-Along Challenges
The follow-along activity includes built-in challenges the students can attempt. For those sections, the instructor should give the students some time to complete the task, and then go over how to do it. In the interest of time, not every student is required to finish each challenge.

## Turtle Challenges
After the follow-along activity, students can attempt the challenges at https://bit.ly/PyChallenges. If they finish those challenges, or become bored, there are additional turtle examples. Students can copy and paste examples and update them as they wish.

At some point during the challenge period, an instructor can show and explain some of the more advanced examples to the whole class. This should hopefully inspire the students to continue playing around with their own turtles.
