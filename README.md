# Programming with Python Workshop
This workshop introduces students to the [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming language through Turtle Graphics.

## Possible Durations
The material in this workshop is adaptable to several different timing options.

### 45 Minutes

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) (no optional sections) | 35m |
| [Turtle Challenges](https://bit.ly/PyChallenges) | 10m |

### 60 Minutes

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) (selected optional sections) | 45m |
| [Turtle Challenges](https://bit.ly/PyChallenges) | 15m |

### 1.5 Hours

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Icebreaker | 10m |
| [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) (selected optional sections) | 45m |
| [Turtle Challenges](https://bit.ly/PyChallenges) | 35m |

### 2.5 Hours

| Activity | Time |
|-|-|
| Icebreaker | 10m |
| [Lecture](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) | 20m |
| [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/programming-with-python-quiz/e467016f-1971-4e14-b247-7e5e0f87c00c) | 10m |
| Break | 10m |
| [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) (with optional sections) | 50m |
| [Turtle Challenges](https://bit.ly/PyChallenges) | 50m |


## Icebreaker
The icebreaker activity is built into the [ProgrammingWithPython.pptx](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) presentation. Students will think of questions, and other students will have to answer them.

Optionally, instead of the PowerPoint icebreaker, choose a different icebreaker for the group. Or, depending on the situation, do not do an icebreaker activity.

## Lecture
The lecture introduces Python using the [Programming With Python](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) presentation. Students will follow along with the lecture using [trinket](https://trinket.io). The lecture covers:
- Python uses
- Trinket
- Printing messages
- Variables
- User input
- Conditionals
- For loops

It should be interactive, and the students should be engaged. The lecture is optional; if the duration is shorter, skip the lecture and start with the code-along.

## Kahoot
There is a [Kahoot](https://create.kahoot.it/share/programming-with-python-quiz/e467016f-1971-4e14-b247-7e5e0f87c00c) quiz that covers the content from the lecture. There is a link to the quiz from the [Programming With Python](ProgrammingWithPython.pptx) presentation. The top three winners can receive candy.

## Turtle Follow-Along
An instructor should walk through the instructions in the [Turtle Follow-Along](TurtleFollowAlong.md) file. Students should follow along and type what the instructor types. The instructor should ask questions of the students along the way, and make sure they are engaged and interacting. The follow-along activity includes built-in challenges the students can attempt.

## Turtle Challenges
After the follow-along activity, students can attempt the challenges at https://bit.ly/PyChallenges. If they finish those challenges, or become bored, there are additional turtle examples. Students can copy and paste examples and update them as they wish.

At some point during the challenge period, an instructor can show and explain some of the more advanced examples to the whole class. This should hopefully inspire the students to continue playing around with their own turtles.
