# Turtle Challenges
Play around with the turtles to create something cool! Feel free to start from the challenges below, or do something completely different.

## Diamond
At the bottom of the `main.py` file, write commands to complete the steps below:

1. Create a new turtle
1. Move them to a good starting point on the screen
  - Remember to make them pick up the pen first!
1. Make them draw a diamond
  - Note: A diamond is simply a tilted square!

## Other Shapes
Create new turtles that draw each of the following shapes:
- Pentagon
- Hexagon
- Septagon
- Parallelogram
- Trapezoid

## Many-pointed star
At the bottom of the `main.py` file, write commands for a new turtle to draw a star with many points! It could look something like this:

### Help
Use the square as a template:
```python
for x in range(4)
  koopa.forward(100)
  koopa.right(90)
```

Change the `4`, `100`, and `90` values so that the turtle moves in the correct way. Try out different numbers until it looks right!

## Complete drawing
Use a turtle to draw a whole picture, like a house or a flower or anything else that comes to mind!

## Turtle examples
Check out the [Turtle Examples](TurtleExamples.md) to see some cool turtle features. Try copying and pasting some of the code, and updating it to create something unique. Change any of the numbers or colors to see how it affects the drawing!
