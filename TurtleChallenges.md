# Turtle Challenges
Play around with the turtles to create something cool! Feel free to start from the challenges below, or do something completely different.

## Pentagon
Update the code so that the turtle draws a pentagon instead of a triangle.

### Code to update
```python
for x in range(3):
    shelly.forward(100)
    shelly.right(120)
```

_HINT: Update the numbers from the triangle loop (the `3` and the `120`) so that the turtle draws the correct number of sides, and turns the correct angle each time_

## Many-pointed star
Update the code so that the turtle draws a many-pointed star! It could look something like this:

_HINT: Try out different numbers in the triangle loop until the shape looks good_

## Other shapes
Create new turtles (or update the existing turtles) and make them draw the following shapes:
- Diamond
- Hexagon
- Septagon
- Parallelogram
- Trapezoid

## Complete drawing
Use a turtle to draw a whole picture, like a house, a flower, an animal, a tree, or anything else that comes to mind!

## Story time
Create a story where each turtle is a character. They should interact by moving, or speak by writing messages to the screen.

## Turtle examples
Check out the [Turtle Examples](TurtleExamples.md) to see some cool turtle features. Try copying and pasting some of the code, and updating it to create something unique. Change any of the numbers or colors to see how it affects the drawing!
